**Description**

This project aims to replicate the design and functionality of the Apple website, using React, Three.js, and Vite mainly. The goal is to create a visually identical clone of the website, while also learning about web development best practices and techniques.


**Features**
------------


* Responsive design, compatible with various devices and screen sizes
* San Francisco font (SF Pro Display) used throughout the website
* Replication of Apple's website layout, including navigation, hero section, and product showcases
* Basic interactivity, such as hover effects and scrolling animations


**Technologies Used**
--------------------

* React
* Vite
* Three.js
* GSAP
* Tailwind CSS
* HTML5
* CSS3 (including Flexbox and Grid)
* JavaScript (including ES6+ syntax)
* SF Pro Display font (open-source alternative to San Francisco font)


**Getting Started**
-------------------


1. Clone the repository using Git: `git clone https://github.com/pakagronglb/3d-react-apple-site-clone.git`
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor or IDE
3. Run the project by installing the dependencies (assuming you already created a project on your IDE)

**Known Issues**
----------------


* The SF Pro Display font may not render correctly on Windows operating systems. To fix this issue, add the following `font-family` declaration to your `src/index.css` file:
```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-family: 'SF Pro Text',-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont,Roboto,'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Symbol';
}
```
This will help to get the closest possible match to the original Apple font.


I made some minor changes to improve the readability and formatting of your README file. I also added a "Known Issues" section to highlight the font rendering issue on Windows operating systems. Let me know if you'd like me to make any further changes!
